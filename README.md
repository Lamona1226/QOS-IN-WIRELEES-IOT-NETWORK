# Packet Analysis with Wireshark & Network Simulation with OMNeT++

this repository documents my work on network packet analysis using Wireshark and network simulation using OMNeT++. The goal was to inspect various protocols (DNS, IP, TCP, HTTP, and UDP) and analyze real network traffic while also leveraging OMNeT++ for controlled network scenario simulations.
üîç Objective

    Capture and analyze real network traffic using Wireshark
    Identify and extract key details from DNS, IP, TCP, HTTP, and UDP packets
    Simulate network behavior using OMNeT++ for deeper insights into packet flow and network performance

üìå Captured Protocols with Wireshark
1Ô∏è‚É£ IP (Internet Protocol)

    Source & destination IP addresses
    Packet size & fragmentation details

2Ô∏è‚É£ TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

    3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)
    Sequence & acknowledgment numbers
    Flags like RST, FIN, PSH

3Ô∏è‚É£ UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

    Connectionless data transfer
    Port numbers & payload size

4Ô∏è‚É£ DNS (Domain Name System)

    Query & response analysis
    IP resolution from domain names

5Ô∏è‚É£ HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

    Request & response headers
    GET and POST requests

üõ† Packet Capture with Wireshark

    Open Wireshark
    Select the appropriate network interface
    Start capturing traffic
    Use filters like:
        ip ‚Üí Capture all IP packets
        tcp ‚Üí Capture TCP packets
        udp ‚Üí Capture UDP packets
        dns ‚Üí Capture DNS queries and responses
        http ‚Üí Capture HTTP traffic
    Analyze packet details in the Packet Details & Packet Bytes pane

üöÄ Why OMNeT++ for Network Simulation?

I chose OMNeT++ due to its powerful capabilities in modeling and simulating network scenarios. Some key benefits include:

    Modular Design: Helps in designing complex network simulations efficiently
    Seamless Integration with INET Framework: Provides ready-to-use models for TCP/IP, routing, and wireless networks
    Custom Scenario Creation: Allows detailed network behavior simulation, such as congestion, delays, and protocol interactions
    Scalability: Suitable for small-scale and large-scale network modeling

üõ† Network Simulation with OMNeT++

    Install OMNeT++ and INET Framework
    Set up network topology (nodes, routers, links)
    Define simulation parameters (bandwidth, delay, packet size)
    Run simulation and analyze results
    Compare with real-world Wireshark captures

üìä Findings & Insights

    Real-world packet analysis (Wireshark) vs. controlled simulation (OMNeT++)
    Network delays, packet loss, and protocol behavior comparison
    Performance analysis of TCP vs. UDP in different scenarios
